## Assumptions

Bookings are done externally and the portal is only a dashboard to aggregrate trips
No payments integration is done on this system as that is handling by booking system
User establishes primary email address for trip bookings,if a secondary email address is used
then it poses a challenge that both emails must be logged in within browser and app and consent is provided by user to crawl/poll email
