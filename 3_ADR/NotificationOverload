Issue:High volume of notifications and loading notifications within few minutes or seconds of the change/update
Decision :Using MQ and Streaming for ensuring there is no packet loss.Redundancy built in for MQ also.
Status :Accepted
Assumptions:All the microservices within the dashboard service subscribed to the change events will be notified and then push to mobile app/email/sms will be initiated by Notifications Manager.

Constraints:Push disabled by app/device user will be a detriment hence sms also has been used.Pull is also supported and can be configured.
Trade-off will be the number of channels on which the user gets notified will be high but this is still better than a missed flight/missed update.
