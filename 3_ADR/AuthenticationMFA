Issue: Authentication using Primary Email	

Decision: Email-based verification: Users receive a one-time code via email. Alternatively Time-based one-time password (TOTP): Users use a mobile app like Google Authenticator to generate codes.

Status : Accepted

Assumptions:User has provided consent to allow Road Warrior App to crawl/parse email contents

Constraints: If user disables this,we will no longer be able to parse the emails and hence this is a limiting constraint that offers little choice to end user.
