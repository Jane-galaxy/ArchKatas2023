This architecture diagram outlines the components and interactions of a travel management system, focusing on user interaction, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for reservations, real-time updates from external systems, and duplicate reservation prevention based on ticket IDs. Here's a theory breakdown of the architecture:

**User Interface**:

The User Interface represents the front-end component of the system where users interact with the travel management system.
It includes User Authentication for secure user access, the Travel Dashboard for managing reservations, and the Reports Generator for generating travel reports.
Database:

The Database component stores essential data, including user information and reservation records.
It ensures data persistence and retrieval for various system functions.
External Systems (Cloud):

External Systems, represented as Cloud, symbolize interactions with external travel providers and systems.
These systems provide real-time updates on travel information, such as flight statuses and hotel bookings.
Travel Dashboard:

The Travel Dashboard is the central component for managing travel reservations.
It enables users to perform CRUD operations on reservations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) both manually and through real-time updates.
Real-time updates from External Systems enhance reservation data with the latest information.
Duplicate Check Logic:

This component is responsible for preventing the addition of duplicate reservations based on ticket IDs.
It is integrated with the Travel Dashboard to validate new reservations against existing ones.
If a duplicate is detected, the system prevents the addition of the reservation.
Reservation Flow:

When a user performs CRUD operations on reservations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), the Travel Dashboard handles the user's request.
The Duplicate Check Logic is triggered when adding a new reservation. It checks if the new reservation has the same ticket ID as an existing one.
If a duplicate is found, the system prevents the addition of the reservation and provides feedback to the user.
If it's a valid reservation, the Travel Dashboard updates the reservation data in the database.
Interactions:

Users interact with the User Interface, which handles login/logout and provides a dashboard for reservation management and report generation.
Real-time updates from External Systems enhance the reservation data with the latest information from travel providers.
The Database stores user data and reservation records, ensuring data integrity.
The Travel Dashboard is the core component that processes user requests and ensures reservations are managed efficiently.
Benefits:

This architecture ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate reservations based on ticket IDs.
Users have full control over their reservations with the ability to manually add, update, or delete them.
Real-time updates complement manual reservation management for a comprehensive travel dashboard.
This architecture provides a clear and structured design for a travel management system, allowing users to efficiently manage their reservations while maintaining data accuracy. It also seamlessly integrates real-time updates to keep travel information up-to-date.
