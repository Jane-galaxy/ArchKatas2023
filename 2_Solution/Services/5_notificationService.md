## Notification System for Real-Time Update

A Notification System is a crucial component in modern applications that provides users with real-time updates, alerts, and messages. In the context of a Travel Dashboard that interacts with various services and external sources, a Notification System plays a vital role in keeping users informed about their travel plans and any relevant updates. Here's a theoretical overview of such a Notification System:

# External Data Sources:
These sources include third-party services like SABRE and APOLLO, which provide real-time travel updates.
The Notification Service can subscribe to these sources to receive updates.

# Communication Services:
SMS, Email, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) are communication channels used for delivering notifications to users.

# External Data Sources Integration:
The Notification Service integrates with external data sources, such as SABRE and APOLLO, to receive real-time travel updates.
It subscribes to these sources and listens for updates.

# Notification Generation:
When an update is received from an external source, the Notification Service generates a notification based on the update's content.
The notification can include details like flight delays, gate changes, hotel reservations, and more.

# Notification Delivery Options:
The Notification Service determines how to deliver the notification to the user.
It may use various communication channels, such as SMS, Email, FCM, or APNs, based on user preferences and device capabilities.

# Travel Dashboard Interaction:
The Travel Dashboard acts as the user's main interface with the system.
It constantly checks for new notifications from the Notification Service.

# Notification Display:
When a new notification arrives, the Travel Dashboard displays it to the user in a user-friendly format.
Users can see real-time updates related to their travel plans directly on the dashboard.

# User Preferences:
Users can configure their notification preferences through the User Interface.
They can choose which types of updates they want to receive and through which communication channels (SMS, Email, FCM, APNs).

# Third-Party Notifications:
External services like APOLLO can also send notifications to the Notification Service.
These notifications can include special offers, promotions, or additional travel information.
